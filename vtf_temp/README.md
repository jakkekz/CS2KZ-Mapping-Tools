# VTF Tools Directory

This directory should contain:
- `VTFCmd.exe` - Command line VTF converter
- `VTFLib.dll` - VTF library dependency

These tools are automatically downloaded and bundled during the GitHub Actions build process.

For manual installation:
1. Download VTFEdit from: https://nemstools.github.io/pages/VTFLib-Download.html
2. Extract `VTFCmd.exe` and `VTFLib.dll` to this directory
3. The skybox converter will automatically detect and use these tools

Note: VTFEdit.exe can be used as VTFCmd.exe if needed (just rename the file).
